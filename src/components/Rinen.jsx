              finest culture, rooted in a love for crypto-art that is built both
              with supreme artistic provenance in the metaverse, as well as in

                Kiwami is a collection of 10,000 NFTs, comprised of hundreds of
                unique visual traits designed by an anonymous Japanese team of
                street art mavericks. The aesthetic character is guided by
                cyberkinetic, urban pop art, and inspired by traditional
                Japanese elements.
